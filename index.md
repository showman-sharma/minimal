## SKY-WRITE-2.0

This project creates an environment to write in the air. No special pen/tools. Just a camera and the user's hand.

When the hand makes the posture of holding a pen, the ink starts getting printed. To choose/ change color, move your index finger towards the given colors. To clear the screen, move the index finger towards 'clear screen'.

Here's the demo: https://youtu.be/5FtQ17qnpa0

## InformationRetreival
For any given query, an Information Retrieval (IR) system is used to obtain and rank relevant word documents from the data collection of interest. The most basic IR system uses Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to represent documents and queries as vectors, and then uses measures like cosine similarity to assess the relevance of a query to all the documents in the dataset.

This TF-IDF based Vector Space Model (VSM) performs admirably, but it has a few flaws, such as the assumption that the words are semantically unrelated, necessitating the development of alternate IR approaches. The NLP community has spent a lot of time looking into ways to capture semantic relatedness in words and documents. Data-driven learning of vector representations from a big corpus is one of the most common ways.
