### SKY-WRITE-2.0

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/sky-write-2.0)

This project creates an environment to write in the air. No special pen/tools. Just a camera and the user's hand.

When the hand makes the posture of holding a pen, the ink starts getting printed. To choose/ change color, move your index finger towards the given colors. To clear the screen, move the index finger towards 'clear screen'.


Here's the demo: https://youtu.be/5FtQ17qnpa0


### RED LIGHT GREEN LIGHT

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/red-light-green-light)

A computer based version of the iconic game as seen in the Netflix series: Squid Game, created using Open CV.

The code uses a simple motion detection technique to detect movements from the instant the doll opens its eyes (red light). It can be played with multiple players, too. Anyone moves during red light, the game gets over.

## Natural Language Processing

### InformationRetreival

For any given query, an Information Retrieval (IR) system is used to obtain and rank relevant word documents from the data collection of interest. The most basic IR system uses Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to represent documents and queries as vectors, and then uses measures like cosine similarity to assess the relevance of a query to all the documents in the dataset.

This TF-IDF based Vector Space Model (VSM) performs admirably, but it has a few flaws, such as the assumption that the words are semantically unrelated, necessitating the development of alternate IR approaches. The NLP community has spent a lot of time looking into ways to capture semantic relatedness in words and documents. Data-driven learning of vector representations from a big corpus is one of the most common ways.

### HANDYMAN CHATBOT

This is a basic chatbot for Handyman Prosthetic, an arm prosthetics company.
Handy is a chatbot trained using deep learning on text data, with a limited response set.

Implementing ALC Tableau. For an ALC KB and a query given in Negation Normal Form pre-generated, using ALC Tableau to determine whether the query is entailed by the KB.

First application: natural language processing;
now also other domains (configuration of technical systems, databases,
chemical process engineering, medical terminology, ...)



## Reinforcement Learning

### Shortest Route using Semi Bandit Algorithms

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)]( https://github.com/showman-sharma/Semi-bandits)

We show performance of various algorithms in semi-bandit setting and try to solve a real word problem of shortest route using the same
 

### Taxi Problem: Shortest Pickup-Drop Route

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/taxi-v3-learning)

In this project, we tried two different Learning Algorithms for Hierarchical RL on the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI gym. SMDP Q-Learning and Intra Option Q-Learning and contrasted them with two other methods that involve hardcoding based on human understanding. We conclude that the solutions learnt by machine are way superior than humans for this problem. Intra Option Q-Learning outperforms SMDP Q-Learning because of better usage of the SARS samples (similar to experience replay). Our algorithms even outperform the Hardcoded Agent. We also demonstrated and concluded the strong effectiveness of state compression on the model performance.


## Internet of Things
### Project B-Eagle

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/project-B-EAGLE)

As gas is going to become an important source of power as the world moves towards a cleaner future, more and more processes & systems will be powered by CNG, LPG, methane and even hydrogen. Along with this, a variety of gases are already in use in the industrial & production sector. As these gases are mostly hazardous or inflammable, in this paper we have suggested an IOT-based gas leakage detection system which monitors concentration of some target gas in a space, finds the source and reports it to prevent accidents. We have done a thorough analysis of the problem, and suggested multiple solutions for different cases & different scales.

We propose a leak source search system mounted on small sized drones or rovers that will accurately reach the source of the gas leak or fire. Subsequently, the drone/rover might act as a beacon locating the source exactly or could manage the hazard if relevantly equipped. Here, we try:

- To create a Gas Leak Source Search System.
- To equip a drone with this system and make it reach the source.
- This drone would act like a beacon, informing the user about the exact location of the source.

### Pulse Oximeter using Smartphone Camera

In this project, we use a smartphone to calculate the pulse of a user. The user is expected to press his/her thumb over the smartphone camera with the flash on. We use this footage to calculate pulse by applying various filtering techniques.
