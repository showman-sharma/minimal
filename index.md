### SKY-WRITE-2.0

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/sky-write-2.0)

This project creates an environment to write in the air. No special pen/tools. Just a camera and the user's hand.

When the hand makes the posture of holding a pen, the ink starts getting printed. To choose/ change color, move your index finger towards the given colors. To clear the screen, move the index finger towards 'clear screen'.


Here's the demo: https://youtu.be/5FtQ17qnpa0


### RED LIGHT GREEN LIGHT

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/red-light-green-light)

A computer based version of the iconic game as seen in the Netflix series: Squid Game, created using Open CV.

The code uses a simple motion detection technique to detect movements from the instant the doll opens its eyes (red light). It can be played with multiple players, too. Anyone moves during red light, the game gets over.

### Melanoma Detection using CNN
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/Melanoma_Detection_CNN)
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- In this project, we use CNN based models that take images of malignant and benign oncological diseases and classify them into 9 classes of different diseases and cancers.
- The training and validation data is formed from the [International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic).
- We build upon one CNN based model architecture, and train it with different augmentation techniques.


## Natural Language Processing

### InformationRetreival

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/red-light-green-light)

For any given query, an Information Retrieval (IR) system is used to obtain and rank relevant word documents from the data collection of interest. The most basic IR system uses Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to represent documents and queries as vectors, and then uses measures like cosine similarity to assess the relevance of a query to all the documents in the dataset.

This TF-IDF based Vector Space Model (VSM) performs admirably, but it has a few flaws, such as the assumption that the words are semantically unrelated, necessitating the development of alternate IR approaches. The NLP community has spent a lot of time looking into ways to capture semantic relatedness in words and documents. Data-driven learning of vector representations from a big corpus is one of the most common ways.

### HANDYMAN CHATBOT

This is a basic chatbot for Handyman Prosthetic, an arm prosthetics company.
Handy is a chatbot trained using deep learning on text data, with a limited response set.

### ALC_tableau

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)]( https://github.com/showman-sharma/ALC_tableau)

Implementing ALC Tableau. For an ALC KB and a query given in Negation Normal Form pre-generated, using ALC Tableau to determine whether the query is entailed by the KB.

First application: natural language processing;
now also other domains (configuration of technical systems, databases,
chemical process engineering, medical terminology, ...)



## Reinforcement Learning

### Shortest Route using Semi Bandit Algorithms

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)]( https://github.com/showman-sharma/Semi-bandits)

We show performance of various algorithms in semi-bandit setting and try to solve a real word problem of shortest route using the same
 

### Taxi Problem: Shortest Pickup-Drop Route

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/taxi-v3-learning)

In this project, we tried two different Learning Algorithms for Hierarchical RL on the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI gym. SMDP Q-Learning and Intra Option Q-Learning and contrasted them with two other methods that involve hardcoding based on human understanding. We conclude that the solutions learnt by machine are way superior than humans for this problem. Intra Option Q-Learning outperforms SMDP Q-Learning because of better usage of the SARS samples (similar to experience replay). Our algorithms even outperform the Hardcoded Agent. We also demonstrated and concluded the strong effectiveness of state compression on the model performance.


## Internet of Things
### Project B-Eagle

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/project-B-EAGLE)

As gas is going to become an important source of power as the world moves towards a cleaner future, more and more processes & systems will be powered by CNG, LPG, methane and even hydrogen. Along with this, a variety of gases are already in use in the industrial & production sector. As these gases are mostly hazardous or inflammable, in this paper we have suggested an IOT-based gas leakage detection system which monitors concentration of some target gas in a space, finds the source and reports it to prevent accidents. We have done a thorough analysis of the problem, and suggested multiple solutions for different cases & different scales.

We propose a leak source search system mounted on small sized drones or rovers that will accurately reach the source of the gas leak or fire. Subsequently, the drone/rover might act as a beacon locating the source exactly or could manage the hazard if relevantly equipped. Here, we try:

- To create a Gas Leak Source Search System.
- To equip a drone with this system and make it reach the source.
- This drone would act like a beacon, informing the user about the exact location of the source.

### Pulse Oximeter using Smartphone Camera

In this project, we use a smartphone to calculate the pulse of a user. The user is expected to press his/her thumb over the smartphone camera with the flash on. We use this footage to calculate pulse by applying various filtering techniques.


## Other Machine Learning and Data Science Projects

### Housing Price Analysis Using Regularized Linear Regression
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/Housing-Price-Analysis)
We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

We try to answer the following questions from our analysis:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

### BIKE SHARING SYSTEM ANALYSIS USING A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/showman-sharma/BIKE_SHARING-LIN-REG-MODEL)
We want to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market, based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles. More specifically we want to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

We achieve this by building a Linear Regression model.

Our model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

### Lending Club Case study
In this project, we analyse the impact of various factors on loan repayment defaulting. 
Exploratory data analysis was performed and observations were drawn, providing suggestions to minimize risk and loss
- We use EDA techniques like Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis, Bayesian analysis and time series analysis
